My name is William, I live on the South coast of the UK. I am married to Lou and we have two children. I am a man of faith. I am part of a micro church which I established with my wife and some friends. I run a small building company with my friend Tim. I love to be by or in the water, pretty much any water and at any time. I love to listen to music and watch sport. I love to cook. I am dyslexic and often intense. I am a one-to-one five on the Enneagram.

<div class="section-title">My Writing.</div>
<div class="section-line"></div>

I write because it helps me to understand what I think and what I feel. I find it easy to think about my feelings, but quite hard to feel them. When I write, it creates a pathway to experience for me and maybe for you too. It provides me with catharsis and captures joy.
You may find my writing to be pretentious and verbose, maybe cringeworthy or derivative, maybe (almost certainly!) intense. That is because I can be all of those things. You will find some hopelessly optimistic and some depressing. Some is deeply personal, and some is entirely frivolous. Some of the things I write will show you the truth of who I am (as far as I saw it at that moment of writing!) and some of it shows who I hope to be. Hopefully, you will also find at least some that you enjoy, that makes you think, that evokes emotion and memory. I am committed to writing more.

<div class="section-title">Why.</div>
<div class="section-line"></div>

Because I said I would to James and to Steve. Because I find other people reading what I write excruciating. Because I want to be known and understood. Because this feels like a safe way to share some of who I am through my creativity. It feels safe for me because it is published and there is no feedback mechanism… I can put it out into the world and stay safe inside a boundary of my own making… and for that reason, I will find some way to receive feedback… eventually. When I do you may congratulate me on being brave.

EICW – Exercise Induced Creative Writing. When I exercise, I feel my mind and body connected, and I write in my head what I am feeling and thinking. Sometimes, in the post-run/cycle/swim rush of endorphins, I am courageous enough to write down these compositions and post them to STRAVA.

Lent – I have committed to writing something each day in Lent as a discipline and as a way of exploring my faith and sense of self.

Faith – Refers to my Christian faith. My faith is my framework for understanding the world; it is precious to me. Sometimes I do not know if God is real. Sometimes I do not know if I believe or if I am pretending to. Sometimes I am pretending to. As a result of this, my faith has become a choice, no longer because I know it to be true but because I choose it. Much like a horseshoe nailed above a door, being lucky, whether you believe in it or not (see Niels Bohr), I rely on the fact that God exists, whether I believe in him or not.
