Stormy sky and whirling wind,

Salty smell and foamy flotsum,

Smashing surf and falling fog,

Numb nose and freezing fingers,

Slip and stumble, shifting shingle,

Hopeful heart, pause and... Peace.

Sunlight slanting, heating hands,

Towards twilight and heading home,

Moment measured and... breathe.
