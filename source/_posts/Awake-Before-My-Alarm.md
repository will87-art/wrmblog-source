As I wake.....
				 
	my mind in tumult flows...

		Round echoes of dreams dis o lv i ng 

	in the current,


Then onrushing lies ahead the rude anxieties of life,
		
	Have I over slept? Why did I say that thing? 

	Did I leave the washing out? How can I face the day? 

	Did I sleep ok? Will I have enough?


Be careful now for if you let them,

fear and worry will envelop!

So, as I rise to wakefulness,

I take control and swing the flow another way.

Towards peaceful thoughts of a tranquil day, 

and so avert the dreadful fate 

of lying still and half awake.


Towards the

	peaceful clouds to dream
	   
 				I wend my 

										way...

Then at my wrist an awful sound!! 

Wrenched up from the deep I hear THAT sound...

The BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
