It's been a year,
We stand and pray, but the words won't spill from me,
The grief has leaded my soul, dampening the rise of fealing,
Weighing the pain beneath the surface, leaving hollowness behind.

We swim on the dazelling path of the sun rise,
I cry in the water just two sobs and nothing more comes out.

I sit on the beach looking out at the incoming tide,
Mirrored in water, the march of time so cutting and relentless,
It's been a year James, we miss you so very much.
