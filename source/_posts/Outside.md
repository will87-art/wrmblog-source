Why would you be inside?
When gnats dance over water,
When the white moon gazes out over the tree tops
When clouds bind the mountain top in peaceful drifts.

Why would you be inside?
When muscles ache and lungs are tired.
When the soft cool breeze brings leaves to life and bathes away the heat of the day.

Why would you be inside?
When the gentle light of dying day drifts the night towards you.
When the sound of voices muffled by thick walls echo faintly over water.

Why would you be inside?
When night time birds wake and chirup softly.
When the cold water beckons and calls out to the ancient one buried deep inside your soul.

Why would you be inside?
When your heart still holds the seeping wound of grief.
When you can rest a while in natures solitude held close in space to breathe
